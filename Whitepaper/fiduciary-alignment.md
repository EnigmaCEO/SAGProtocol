# Fiduciary Alignment

Sagitta aligns with fiduciary principles through **deterministic system architecture** that governs capital protection, loss handling, and incentive alignment at all times.

Fiduciary behavior is encoded directly into protocol structure, ensuring that depositor protection, capital discipline, and accountability are enforced continuously through rule-based mechanisms rather than discretionary decision-making.

***

#### Principal Protection as a Core Invariant

Sagitta establishes depositor principal protection as a **first-order system invariant**.

Deposits are backed by a capitalized Reserve that functions as deposit insurance, including coverage for allocation underperformance, execution failure, stable unit impairment, and Vault system failure. Principal restoration is executed through pre-funded Reserve mechanisms and enforced at settlement boundaries.

This structure mirrors the functional role of deposit insurance in traditional finance while operating through automated capital enforcement.

***

#### Structured Loss Absorption

Sagitta implements a **defined loss absorption framework** that assigns downside responsibility at the protocol level.

Allocation outcomes are reconciled through an ordered settlement process in which yield variability, Treasury-retained capital, and Reserve assets collectively absorb underperformance. Depositor principal remains protected throughout all allocation cycles.

This framework ensures that risk is borne by system capital rather than transferred to depositors.

***

#### Reserve-Relative Performance Evaluation

Sagitta evaluates allocation outcomes relative to its own protection mechanisms.

Reserve value is recorded at allocation inception and re-evaluated at settlement. When Reserve assets outperform active allocation strategies over the same interval, a defined portion of Reserve appreciation is credited to depositors as substituted yield.

This mechanism aligns allocation intelligence with capital preservation and rewards outcomes that justify risk relative to protection.

***

#### Capital Discipline and Growth Governance

Sagitta governs growth through insured capacity rather than demand expansion.

Deposit acceptance, allocation sizing, and liquidity formation are bounded by Reserve coverage ratios. As Reserve capacity increases through retained performance, system scale expands proportionally.

This approach ensures that growth reflects earned solvency rather than leverage.

***

#### Functional Separation of Authority

Sagitta structures fiduciary alignment through **clear separation of system roles**.

* The Vault enforces depositor accounting and ownership records
* The Treasury coordinates allocation, settlement, and monetary operations
* The Reserve insures deposits and absorbs systemic losses
* The Continuity Engine governs behavior under failure conditions

This separation ensures that capital protection remains independent of allocation and execution decisions.

***

#### Deterministic Enforcement

Sagitta enforces fiduciary alignment through **predefined rules, ratios, and settlement doctrines**.

Loss handling, Reserve drawdown, yield substitution, and recapitalization behaviors are established in advance and executed mechanically. Outcomes remain predictable and auditable across all operating conditions.

***

#### Fiduciary-Grade by Architecture

Sagitta expresses fiduciary alignment through **capital-backed guarantees, explicit accountability, and disciplined growth mechanics**.

Depositor protection, loss absorption, and performance evaluation are enforced structurally rather than rhetorically. Fiduciary behavior emerges from system design and persists independently of operator intent.

Fiduciary alignment in Sagitta is **encoded**.
