# Executive Summary

Sagitta Protocol is an autonomous, fiduciary-grade investment engine that enforces trustless capital management through continuity governance and gold-backed insurance.

The protocol is designed to preserve capital, discipline risk, and survive systemic failure through architecture rather than discretion. Sagitta restructures capital allocation as an insured, rule-bound, and continuity-governed system instead of a market-dependent or trust-based arrangement.

***

### Problem Context

Modern capital allocation systems expose participants to layered risks without enforcing commensurate protection. Yield optimization, leverage, discretionary governance, and dependency on external infrastructure frequently transfer downside to users while insulating decision-makers.

Sagitta addresses this problem by treating **capital protection, loss accountability, and survivability as first-class system requirements**, not secondary features.

***

### Protocol Overview

Sagitta is composed of distinct, cooperating subsystems, each operating under defined authority boundaries:

* **Vault** — protocol-level custody and accounting for contributed capital
* **Treasury** — monetary authority governing liquidity formation, allocation batches, and settlement
* **Reserve** — capitalized, gold-backed insurance layer protecting participant principal
* **Autonomous Allocation Agent** — quantitative intelligence providing risk-aware allocation recommendations
* **Escrow** — isolated execution boundary interfacing with external allocation venues
* **Sagitta Continuity Engine** — survival authority governing evacuation, substitution, and reconstitution under failure

No single subsystem is indispensable. Authority is layered to prevent risk concentration.

### Capital Protection and Fiduciary Discipline

Sagitta enforces fiduciary alignment structurally.

Participant principal is protected through reserve-backed insurance and deterministic settlement. Allocation underperformance is absorbed at the protocol level through ordered loss handling rather than passed to participants. Growth is constrained by insured capacity, ensuring solvency precedes expansion.

Fiduciary behavior is enforced by protocol law rather than operator intent.

***

### Survivability and Continuity

Sagitta is designed to operate under adverse conditions, including:

* allocation losses
* stablecoin depegs
* reserve asset volatility
* governance compromise
* execution or counterparty failure
* blockchain-level disruption

The Sagitta Continuity Engine governs response through predefined doctrine, ensuring depositor protection and system solvency persist during evacuation, substitution, and recovery.

Survival is treated as a deterministic system function.

***

### Role-Based and Chain-Agnostic Design

All critical dependencies within Sagitta are defined by role rather than fixed implementation. Currencies, tokens, execution venues, governance mechanisms, and blockchain environments are replaceable without redesigning the protocol.

This role-based design enables adaptability across market, infrastructure, and regulatory conditions while preserving core guarantees.

***

### System Invariants

Sagitta operates under immutable system invariants, including:

* preservation of participant principal
* insurance-constrained growth
* protocol-level loss accountability
* reserve supremacy over optimization
* deterministic settlement
* continuity governance under failure

These invariants constrain all protocol behavior, upgrades, and governance actions.

***

### Protocol Intent

Sagitta does not pursue yield maximization, leverage amplification, or market reflexivity.

The protocol prioritizes:

* capital preservation
* solvency enforcement
* disciplined allocation
* long-term continuity

Sagitta is built to function when conditions deteriorate, not only when they are favorable.

***

### Summary

Sagitta Protocol defines a new class of financial infrastructure: **insured, autonomous, and continuity-governed capital allocation**.

By enforcing fiduciary discipline through architecture, reserves, and protocol law, Sagitta transforms capital management from a trust-based activity into a survivable system.

The protocol exists to ensure that **capital remains protected, accountable, and continuous across all states of operation**.
