# Continuity Engine

### 1. Mandate

The Sagitta Continuity Engine is the **survival and continuity authority** of the Sagitta Protocol.

Its mandate is to preserve depositor protection, system solvency, and operational continuity under extreme conditions, including infrastructure failure, asset impairment, governance disruption, and external systemic events.

The Continuity Engine governs **how the protocol behaves when normal assumptions fail**.

***

### 2. Position Within the Sagitta System

The Sagitta Continuity Engine operates as an **overlay authority** across all protocol subsystems.

* The **Vault** records depositor balances and ownership
* The **Treasury** coordinates allocation, settlement, and monetary operations
* The **Reserve** insures deposits and absorbs systemic losses
* The **Autonomous Allocation Agent** evaluates strategies
* The **Escrow** executes and custodies capital
* The **Sagitta Continuity Engine** governs survival, evacuation, and substitution

The Continuity Engine does not participate in routine operations.\
It defines **how authority is exercised when conditions deviate from expected bounds**.

***

### 3. Continuity Philosophy

Sagitta is designed to survive the failure of any single component, asset, or dependency.

The Continuity Engine encodes the principle that:

* systems degrade gracefully rather than collapse,
* dependencies are replaceable by role,
* capital protection takes precedence over optimization.

Continuity is treated as an **active system**, not a contingency plan.

***

### 4. Role-Based Substitution Doctrine

Sagitta treats all critical dependencies as **roles**, not identities.

Examples include:

* Stability Unit
* Treasury Token
* Reserve Asset
* Execution Venue
* Allocation Intelligence
* Governance Authority

Each role has:

* defined functional responsibilities
* acceptable substitution candidates
* migration procedures

The Continuity Engine authorizes **role substitution** when an implementation no longer satisfies system requirements.

This doctrine enables replacement without redesign.

***

### 5. Chain-Agnostic Posture

Sagitta is designed as a **chain-agnostic protocol**.

No blockchain network is treated as an indispensable dependency. All ledger environments are considered implementations of a **Settlement and Execution Role**, subject to substitution under continuity doctrine.

This posture ensures that protocol solvency, depositor protection, and operational continuity remain intact regardless of the condition of any single blockchain.

***

#### 5.1 Blockchain as a Replaceable Role

Sagitta treats blockchains as **state and execution substrates**, not as sources of trust.

Each chain role is defined by:

* state availability
* transaction finality
* execution integrity
* censorship resistance

When a blockchain no longer satisfies these properties, it ceases to meet the role requirements and becomes eligible for substitution.

***

#### 5.2 Blockchain Failure Coverage

The Sagitta Continuity Engine governs protocol behavior under blockchain-level failure conditions, including:

* chain halts or prolonged liveness failure
* consensus disruption or validator collapse
* censorship or transaction exclusion
* irrecoverable reorganization or state corruption

These events are classified as **infrastructure-level failures** and trigger continuity responses without reliance on governance intervention.

***

#### 5.3 Evacuation and Substitution Doctrine

Upon blockchain failure classification, the Continuity Engine coordinates:

* suspension of execution and settlement on the affected chain
* snapshotting of last valid protocol state
* evacuation of capital from execution contexts where possible
* migration to an alternate chain role
* reconstitution of protocol state under the new substrate

Depositor balances and insured value remain invariant throughout this process.

***

#### 5.3 Multi-Chain and Cross-Domain Readiness

Sagitta’s architecture supports deployment across multiple chains and execution environments.

State representation, accounting logic, and authority boundaries are designed to be portable across:

* public blockchains
* permissioned ledgers
* hybrid execution environments

Chain selection reflects operational suitability rather than ideological commitment.

***

#### 5.4 Survivability Guarantee

Chain failure does not constitute protocol failure.

Sagitta’s continuity posture ensures that:

* depositor protection persists
* Reserve enforcement remains intact
* Treasury authority continues under substituted settlement
* protocol operation resumes after reconstitution

The protocol survives by **changing where it runs**, not by compromising what it guarantees.

***

### 6. Failure Classification and Detection

The Continuity Engine monitors protocol health through continuous state evaluation.

Failure conditions are classified across domains, including:

* asset impairment or depegging
* execution venue failure
* Reserve degradation
* governance paralysis
* infrastructure or oracle disruption

Each class maps to predefined continuity responses.

***

### 7. Continuity States

The protocol operates under defined **continuity states**.

Typical states include:

* **Normal Operation**
* **Constrained Operation**
* **Degraded Operation**
* **Evacuation Mode**
* **Reconstitution Mode**

State transitions are rule-driven and observable.

***

### 8. Evacuation Doctrine

Evacuation is the process of **withdrawing capital from risk-bearing or compromised environments** into protected custody.

When evacuation is triggered, the Continuity Engine coordinates:

* halting of new allocations
* suspension of execution activity
* recall of deployed capital from Escrow
* consolidation of assets into Stability Units or Reserve form
* freezing of non-essential state transitions

Evacuation prioritizes **speed, determinism, and capital integrity** over yield or optimization.

***

### 9. Asset Substitution Processes

When an asset role becomes impaired, the Continuity Engine initiates **substitution procedures**.

Examples include:

* replacing a Stability Unit experiencing depegging
* replacing a Reserve asset experiencing correlation failure
* migrating execution venues
* transitioning Treasury Token implementations

Substitution proceeds through:

1. snapshotting system state
2. valuation normalization
3. controlled migration
4. post-migration reconciliation

Depositor balances remain invariant throughout substitution.

***

### 10. Vault Failure Recovery

In the event of Vault system failure, the Continuity Engine coordinates **deposit reconstruction and restoration**.

This process includes:

* recovery of last valid depositor state
* Reserve-backed principal restoration
* migration to alternative custody or Vault implementations

Vault failure does not impair depositor claims.

***

### 11. Treasury and Monetary Continuity

Under continuity conditions affecting monetary operations, the Continuity Engine governs:

* suspension or adjustment of Treasury Token issuance
* modification of buyback and burn cadence
* prioritization of Reserve reinforcement
* preservation of allocation solvency

Monetary actions under continuity doctrine favor **capital preservation and system stability**.

***

### 12. Allocation Intelligence Degradation

The Continuity Engine governs analytical posture under stress.

Possible actions include:

* narrowing eligible strategies
* prioritizing Reserve-relative performance
* suspending adaptive learning
* freezing recommendation output

Analytical intelligence adapts to continuity state without altering depositor guarantees.

***

### 13. Escrow and Execution Recovery

For execution-layer disruption, the Continuity Engine coordinates:

* execution halts
* capital recall
* venue substitution
* jurisdictional rerouting

Capital isolation ensures that execution failures remain contained.

***

### 14. Reconstitution and Return to Normal Operation

After evacuation or substitution, the Continuity Engine oversees **system reconstitution**.

This includes:

* validation of new role implementations
* reconciliation of balances and accounting
* gradual reactivation of allocation activity
* restoration of normal cadence

Reconstitution proceeds only after solvency and protection thresholds are met.

***

### 15. Autonomy and Governance Interaction

The Continuity Engine operates autonomously within defined doctrine.

Governance defines:

* continuity thresholds
* substitution candidates
* evacuation permissions

Execution of continuity actions proceeds without discretionary delay.

This separation ensures decisive response under stress.

***

### 16. Standalone Deployment

The Sagitta Continuity Engine is deployable as a standalone survival framework.

It may operate as:

* a blockchain evacuation system
* a protocol continuity service
* an asset migration and substitution engine
* an autonomous failure response layer

Standalone deployment enables continuity protection beyond Sagitta.

***

### 17. Summary

The Sagitta Continuity Engine is the **guardian of survival**.

It:

* governs evacuation under failure
* enables role-based substitution
* preserves depositor protection
* coordinates recovery and reconstitution
* ensures the protocol endures beyond individual components

Sagitta does not assume permanence.\
It **plans for replacement**.

Continuity is not an exception state.\
It is a **designed capability**.
