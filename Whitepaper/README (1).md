### 1. Protocol Identity

Sagitta is a **gold-backed, insurance-first capital allocation protocol** designed to preserve depositor principal, discipline risk-taking, and maintain continuity under adverse conditions.

The protocol coordinates custody, allocation, execution, insurance, intelligence, and survival through a layered system of authorities. Each authority operates within defined bounds, and no single component is indispensable to system survival.

Sagitta is constructed as **financial infrastructure**, not a product.

***

### 2. Problem Domain

Modern capital allocation systems expose participants to layered risks without enforcing commensurate protection. Yield optimization, leverage, governance discretion, and dependency fragility frequently transfer downside to users while insulating decision-makers.

Sagitta addresses this problem class by restructuring capital flow around three core principles:

* **Insurance precedes optimization**
* **Loss accountability resides at the protocol level**
* **Survivability is designed, not assumed**

These principles define Sagitta’s role as a fiduciary-aligned system rather than a speculative mechanism.

***

### 3. System Guarantees

Sagitta enforces the following guarantees as **protocol invariants**:

* Depositor principal protection through capitalized insurance
* Reserve-constrained growth proportional to insured capacity
* Explicit loss absorption and accountability
* Deterministic settlement across allocation outcomes
* Continuity under component, asset, or governance failure

These guarantees are enforced structurally through capital backing, rule-based settlement, and predefined authority boundaries.

***

### 4. Layered Authority Model

Sagitta operates through a **layered authority architecture** that separates concerns and prevents risk concentration.

* **Custody and accounting** are isolated from allocation decisions
* **Allocation intelligence** is isolated from capital movement
* **Execution** is isolated from policy formation
* **Insurance** is isolated from yield generation
* **Continuity** overrides all subsystems during failure conditions

This separation ensures that no single layer can unilaterally expose depositors to risk.

***

### 5. Capital Flow Overview

Capital within Sagitta follows a deterministic lifecycle:

1. Deposits are recorded and protected through the Vault
2. Allocation liquidity is formed and governed by the Treasury
3. Allocation intelligence evaluates risk and opportunity
4. Execution is carried out through isolated Escrow contexts
5. Outcomes are settled and reconciled deterministically
6. Losses are absorbed and insurance enforced by the Reserve
7. Continuity actions govern evacuation, substitution, and recovery

Each stage operates under defined authority and bounded responsibility.

***

### 6. Role-Based Design Doctrine

Sagitta treats all critical dependencies as **roles**, not fixed implementations.

Roles include:

* Stability Unit
* Treasury Token
* Reserve Asset
* Allocation Intelligence
* Execution Venue
* Governance Authority

Each role has defined responsibilities, acceptable substitutions, and migration procedures. This design enables replacement without systemic redesign and ensures adaptability under stress.

***

### 7. Fiduciary Alignment by Architecture

Sagitta aligns with fiduciary principles through **system design rather than discretionary promise**.

Principal protection, loss absorption, reserve-relative performance evaluation, and constrained growth are enforced mechanically. Risk-taking is justified only when it outperforms protection, and underperformance results in protocol-level consequence.

Fiduciary behavior emerges from structure and persists across market cycles.

***

### 8. Survivability and Continuity

Sagitta is designed to survive:

* asset impairment and currency depegs
* token market disruption
* governance compromise
* execution and counterparty failure
* infrastructure and oracle disruption

The Sagitta Continuity Engine governs evacuation, substitution, degradation, and reconstitution through predefined doctrine. Continuity actions preserve depositor protection and system solvency while restoring operational capacity.

Survival is treated as a **first-class system function**.

***

### 9. Modular and Standalone Architecture

Each Sagitta subsystem is independently deployable and licensable:

* Vault as a custody and accounting layer
* Treasury as a monetary and allocation authority
* Reserve as a decentralized insurance system
* Autonomous Allocation Agent as a quantitative intelligence layer
* Escrow as an execution and compliance boundary
* Continuity Engine as a survival and substitution framework

Together, these systems form a coherent protocol. Individually, they operate as infrastructure components suitable for external integration.

***

### 10. Protocol Posture

Sagitta does not pursue yield maximization, leverage amplification, or dependency concentration.

The protocol prioritizes:

* capital preservation
* solvency enforcement
* disciplined allocation
* structural accountability
* long-term continuity

Growth is earned through retained performance and reinforced insurance capacity.

***

### 11. Summary

Sagitta is a **capital allocation protocol designed to endure**.

It insures deposits, disciplines risk, penalizes underperformance, and survives component failure through layered authority and reserve-backed guarantees.

Sagitta does not assume favorable conditions.\
It is built to operate when conditions deteriorate.

The protocol exists to ensure that **capital remains protected, accountable, and continuous across all states of the system**.
