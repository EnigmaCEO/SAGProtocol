# Autonomous Allocation Agent

### 1. Mandate

The Autonomous Allocation Agent is the quantitative **analytical intelligence layer** of the Sagitta Protocol.

Its mandate is to evaluate allocation opportunities, model risk and performance outcomes, and provide structured intelligence to the Treasury for capital routing decisions. The agent enhances allocation quality through continuous analysis while operating within defined system constraints.

The Autonomous Allocation Agent informs decisions.\
The Treasury commits capital.

***

### 2. Position Within the Sagitta System

The Autonomous Allocation Agent operates as a **non-custodial, non-executing analytical office** within the protocol.

* The **Sagitta Vault** records deposits and enforces accounting rules
* The **Sagitta Treasury** forms liquidity, allocates capital, and settles outcomes
* The **Sagitta Reserve** insures deposits and absorbs underperformance
* The **Sagitta Escrow** executes capital deployment
* The **Autonomous Allocation Agent** evaluates strategies and outcomes
* The **Sagitta Continuity Engine** governs system behavior under failure

The agent exists upstream of execution and downstream of policy, translating strategy space into actionable insight.

***

### 3. Scope of Analysis

The Autonomous Allocation Agent evaluates candidate allocation strategies across multiple dimensions, including:

* expected return profiles
* volatility and drawdown characteristics
* liquidity and duration properties
* counterparty and execution risk
* correlation with Reserve assets
* historical and simulated performance

Analysis is performed across defined time horizons aligned with allocation batch cadence.

***

### 4. Quantitative Foundation

The Autonomous Allocation Agent is grounded in **quantitative finance methodologies** traditionally employed by professional asset managers, risk desks, and portfolio construction teams.

Its analytical core reflects established quant practices, including:

* factor-based return analysis
* volatility and drawdown modeling
* correlation and covariance analysis
* scenario and regime simulation
* risk-adjusted performance metrics
* capital efficiency and duration modeling

These methods provide a mathematically rigorous baseline for evaluating allocation strategies across diverse market conditions.

The agent does not invent financial theory.\
It operationalizes it at scale.

***

### 5. Human–Quant–Machine Alignment

Sagitta treats quantitative intelligence as a **shared discipline**, not a replacement for expertise.

The Autonomous Allocation Agent is designed to operate in alignment with:

* established quantitative finance principles
* domain knowledge from professional quants
* Treasury-defined risk and solvency doctrine

Human quant insight informs:

* model selection
* constraint design
* evaluation criteria
* interpretation of edge cases

Machine intelligence contributes:

* scale
* consistency
* simulation depth
* adaptive pattern recognition

This alignment ensures that allocation intelligence remains **disciplined, explainable, and fiduciary-aligned**.

***

### 6. Quantitative Explainability

All agent outputs are expressed in **quant-native terms** familiar to institutional allocators.

Recommendations include:

* comparative return distributions
* risk-adjusted metrics
* sensitivity to shocks
* Reserve-relative performance deltas

This presentation allows Treasury operators, auditors, and external reviewers to assess recommendations using standard financial reasoning rather than opaque model outputs.

***

### 7. Strategy Evaluation Framework

The agent operates through a **scenario-driven evaluation framework**.

For each candidate strategy, the agent:

* simulates performance across varied market conditions
* evaluates sensitivity to shocks and regime changes
* estimates impact on Treasury balance sheet and Reserve ratios
* compares outcomes relative to passive Reserve performance

Evaluation outputs are normalized into comparable metrics to support disciplined allocation decisions.

***

### 8. Reserve-Relative Intelligence

The Autonomous Allocation Agent incorporates **Reserve-relative benchmarking** as a core analytical dimension.

Active strategies are evaluated against the performance of Reserve assets over equivalent intervals. This benchmarking ensures that proposed risk-taking is justified relative to passive protection and aligns analytical incentives with fiduciary preservation.

Strategies that fail to outperform protection mechanisms are deprioritized.

***

### 9. Interaction With the Treasury

The Autonomous Allocation Agent produces **recommendations, rankings, and explanatory analysis** for Treasury review.

Treasury decisions incorporate:

* agent evaluations
* Reserve coverage constraints
* liquidity requirements
* continuity posture

The agent does not initiate allocation, modify batch sizing, or execute transactions. Its role is advisory and analytical.

***

### 10. Learning and Adaptation

The agent updates its evaluation models continuously using realized batch outcomes.

Performance data from settled batches feeds back into:

* risk estimation models
* correlation assumptions
* scenario weighting
* strategy ranking heuristics

This adaptive process improves analytical accuracy while remaining bounded by Treasury doctrine and Reserve discipline.

***

### 11. Explainability and Auditability

The Autonomous Allocation Agent generates **explainable outputs**.

For each recommendation, the agent produces:

* rationale summaries
* contributing factors
* comparative metrics
* confidence assessments

All analytical outputs are logged, versioned, and auditable. This ensures transparency of reasoning and traceability of influence on Treasury decisions.

***

### 12. Independence From Execution and Custody

The Autonomous Allocation Agent does not custody assets, hold keys, or interface directly with execution venues.

Its independence from capital movement preserves system integrity, reduces attack surface, and prevents analytical intelligence from becoming an execution authority.

***

### 13. Continuity and Degradation Behavior

Under continuity events, the agent adjusts analytical posture.

Possible modes include:

* conservative strategy filtering
* stress-prioritized evaluation
* reduced recommendation bandwidth
* analysis suspension during emergency states

The agent adapts to system posture without altering capital guarantees.

***

### 14. Standalone Deployment

The Autonomous Allocation Agent is deployable as a standalone analytical system.

It may operate as:

* a portfolio evaluation engine
* a risk modeling service
* an allocation intelligence layer for funds or protocols
* a decision-support system for fiduciary capital managers

Standalone deployment preserves analytical independence from custody and execution.

***

### 15. Summary

The Autonomous Allocation Agent strengthens allocation decisions through disciplined analysis.

It:

* evaluates strategy performance and risk
* benchmarks outcomes against Reserve protection
* adapts through feedback and learning
* produces explainable, auditable intelligence

Sagitta treats intelligence as **advisory**, capital as **disciplined**, and protection as **invariant**.

Sagitta treats quantitative finance as a discipline to be scaled, not replaced.

The Autonomous Allocation Agent exists to ensure that **risk is taken consciously, evaluated rigorously, and justified continuously**.
