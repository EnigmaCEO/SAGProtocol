# Scope & Non-Banking Clarification

### Purpose

This section defines the **scope of the Sagitta Protocol** and clarifies its **non-banking posture**.

It exists to distinguish protocol-level capital mechanics from regulated financial activities performed by traditional institutions, while preserving the integrity and authority of the protocol’s design.

This clarification governs interpretation of all subsequent chapters.

***

### Protocol Scope

Sagitta is a **protocol-defined financial system**, not a banking institution, trust company, or custodial service provider.

All capital interactions described in this document occur at the **protocol level**, governed by deterministic rules, smart-contract logic, and system invariants. No legal entity exercises discretionary control over participant capital.

Sagitta defines:

* how capital is recorded,
* how it may be allocated,
* how outcomes are settled, and
* how protection and continuity are enforced,

through **protocol law**, not corporate discretion.

***

### Non-Banking Posture

The Sagitta Protocol does **not** engage in banking, trust, or deposit-taking business.

Specifically:

* The protocol does not accept deposits as banking liabilities
* The protocol does not operate deposit accounts
* The protocol does not offer on-demand withdrawal promises characteristic of banking
* No legal entity guarantees repayment as a balance-sheet obligation

References in this document to “deposits,” “depositors,” or similar terms describe **protocol-level capital contributions** governed by system accounting and invariants, not deposits held by or owed from a regulated financial institution.

***

### Capital Contributions and Protocol Accounting

Capital contributed to Sagitta is governed by:

* protocol-defined custody and accounting logic,
* rule-based allocation and settlement,
* reserve-backed protection mechanisms, and
* continuity governance.

Capital protection arises from **structural design**, including reserves, loss-absorption ordering, and deterministic settlement, rather than from corporate guarantees or discretionary promises.

***

### Insurance and Protection Clarification

Any reference to “insurance” within Sagitta describes **protocol-level reserve mechanisms** that absorb losses and preserve principal according to predefined rules.

Such mechanisms:

* are capitalized within the protocol,
* operate automatically under protocol law, and
* do not constitute insurance contracts issued by an insurer or guaranteed by a legal entity.

Protection is enforced **mechanically**, not contractually.

***

### Governance and Authority Boundary

Governance within Sagitta:

* defines parameters,
* approves doctrine, and
* oversees upgrades,

but does not exercise discretionary custody or banking authority.

Protocol behavior remains constrained by system invariants regardless of governance composition or outcomes.

***

### Interpretation Guidance

This whitepaper describes **how the Sagitta Protocol functions**, not how any specific legal entity conducts regulated financial business.

Where legal entities interact with the protocol (e.g., development, governance facilitation, or infrastructure support), such activities are separate from and subordinate to protocol-level operation.

***

### Closing Statement

Sagitta is designed as **financial infrastructure governed by protocol law**, not as a bank, trust, or custodial institution.

Capital safety, discipline, and continuity emerge from **structure, reserves, and enforcement**, not from reliance on corporate promises or regulatory classification.

This clarification preserves both:

* the **sovereignty of the protocol**, and
* the **integrity of applicable legal boundaries**.
